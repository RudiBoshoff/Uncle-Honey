# Uncle-Honey
Uncle honey is a fictitious company that produces honey and offers honey production tours. I designed the logo and then decided to turn it into a "cute" stylized website.
The app makes use of swiper.js when in mobile to cycle through the different honey production cards.

TODO:
  1. improve original layouts to reduce media queries using clamp and other newly acquired knowledge.
  2. improve button accessibility (focus, hover, click,etc.)
  3. add aria tags
  4. Host app on Heroku
